1 lb raw hamburger
3 tbsp grey poupon mustard
1 tbsp garlic powder
2 tbsp worcestershire sauce

Mix ingredients in large bowl by hand (fun!)
Make large patties using handfuls of mixture

Add salt & pepper or hamburger seasoning to taste
Grill on your favorite flesh-searing device or 
pan-fry (not as much fun)

Place on hamburger bun with your favorite condiments, or eat on a plate.
Serve with fries or other artery-clogging delights.

Enjoy!
